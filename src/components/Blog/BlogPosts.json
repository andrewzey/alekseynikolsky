    "description": "\"Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast\" was a theme which ran through the recital of the maverick pianist, Mikhail Voskresensky. The program included compositions by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Scriabin, and Prokofiev -- followed by 2 encores by Gluck/Sgambatti and Chopin -- all presenting an Apollonian outlook on the calamities that shook the \"Russian World\" and undermined the very foundation of a long-lived tradition of Russian pianism - one of the brightest representatives of which is Mikhail Voskresensky."
