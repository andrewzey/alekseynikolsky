    "description": "Together with language, music is perhaps the most distinctive behavioral trait of the human species. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why only humans perform music and how this ability might have evolved in our species. In this paper, together with my co-author, Antonio Benitez-Burraco, we summarize our new model of co-evolution of music and language in light of the evolution of social organization. We specifically argue that the process of progressive reduction in aggressive behaviors, similar to domestication of animals, can account for some of the cognitive changes conducive to the emergence of complexity in music through a cultural mechanism. We hypothesize four stages in the evolution of music under self-domestication forces: (1) collective proto-music; (2) private, timbre-oriented music; (3) small-group, pitch-oriented music; and (4) collective, tonally organized music. This line of development encompasses the worldwide diversity of music types and genres and parallels what has been hypothesized for languages. Overall, music diversity might have emerged in a gradual fashion under the effects of the enhanced cultural niche construction as shaped by the progressive decrease in reactive (i.e., impulsive, triggered by fear or anger) aggression and the increase in proactive (i.e., premeditated, goal-directed) aggression."

    "description": "Together with my co-author, Antonio Benitez-Burraco, we advance a new model of music evolution that builds on the theory of self-domestication. According to it, the human phenotype is the outcome of a process similar to mammal domestication, triggered by a progressive reduction in reactive aggression. We hypothesize the following line of the evolutionary development of music: starting from musilanguage, proto-music gave rise to personal and private forms of timbre-oriented music, then to small-group ensembles of pitch-oriented music, at first of indefinite and then definite pitch, and finally to collective (tonal) music. This paper addresses numerous controversies in the literature on the evolution of music by providing a clear structural definition of music, identifying its structural features that distinguish it from oral language, and summarizing the typology of operational functions of music and formats of its transmission. Especially valuable contribution to the understanding of transition from animal communication to human music and language is the theory of the so-called “personal song”, described and analyzed here from ethological, social, cultural, cognitive, and musicological perspectives. The emergence of personal song and its development into a social institution are interlinked with the evolution of kinship and placed into the timeline of cultural evolution, based on totality of ethnographic, archaeological, anthropological, genetic, and paleoclimatic data."

A thorough review of common structural patterns in 38 carefully selected pairs of audio and image demonstrations identifies major milestones in the evolution of the treatment of pitch in musical texture and of the spatial representation of depth in pictorial images. They both tend to be nearly equally complex in prehistoric cultures, but music complexity exponentially increases towards the late Middle Ages, making music a likely primary agent for distribution of culturally popular models of representation of perceptual reality as technological progress accelerates."

Together with Leonid Perlovsky, we invited the specialists in these fields to update the findings of that ground-breaking book and to add the new perspectives from organology, musicological analysis, geomusicology, demography, information theory, statistical modeling, paleo-aesthetics, paleo-phonology and biological motion. In addition, we addressed a number of interdisciplinary problems, especially the growing conviction amongst Western ethnomusicologists that the humanities and the sciences are fundamentally split, and that the scientific approach somehow introduces an \"anti-humanitarian\" bias.\" I contributed a number of my own chapters to this book."

Vocalizations of human infants and animal calls that express an emotional state but are indefinite in pitch can be approached in the same way, as “proto-music”. Such comparative analysis has the potential to identify structural differences between music, speech and animal communication. The analysis of tonal organization might equip a musicologist with a novel source of information about the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of conventional forms of music-making – in addition to the ethnomusicologal methods of observing musical behavior and interviewing musicians."

    "description": "This paper defines a new line of inquiry into when and how music obtained its capacity to express. Eleven principal expressive aspects of music are shown to be associated with specific structural patterns whose configuration signifies a certain affective state. This distinguishes the tonal organization of music from the phonetic and prosodic organization of natural languages and from animal communication. The question of music’s origin can therefore be answered by establishing the point in human history at which all eleven expressive aspects might have been abstracted from instinct-driven vocalizations and used to express human emotional states. This most likely occurred through cross-specific communication between humans and domesticated animals during the Neolithic demographic explosion and cultural revolution. Changes in distance between the singing herder and the herd may have generated the basic musical grammar. The surviving tradition of Scandinavian pastoral music – kulning – provides the model for such transformation. This cross-species communication seems to have been more critical for survival of both humans and domestic animals and more direct in ensuring effective transmission of information than person-to-person musical communication and therefore more instrumental in forging the foundation for musical semiosis that afterwards might have supported the person-to-person application."

    "description": "The current scientific research in music has been skewed in favor of its frequency-based variety prevalent in the West. Its alternative, timbre-based music, native to Northeastern Eurasia, seems to represent an earlier evolutionary development. Western researchers interpret it as “defective” implementations of frequency-based music and often regard pitch as a structural criterion that distinguishes music from non-music. Here, my co-authors and I present evidence that, on the contrary, there are genuine indigenous music systems based on the discretization and patterning of aspects of timbre, rather than pitch. Such music is distinguished by its personal orientation: for oneself and/or for close relatives/friends. Collective music-making is rare and exceptional because of the deeply rooted institute of “personal song” - a system of personal identification through individualized patterns of rhythm, timbre, and pitch contour—whose sound enables the recognition of a particular individual."

Indiscriminate until shortly after birth, babies’ vocalizations gradually form acoustic features accompanied by behaviors that make it possible to distinguish attempts to speak from attempts to sing. Comparative analysis of tonal organization of children’s original (non-imitative) vocalizations throughout the first 3 years of life throws light on several important acoustic features. These features play an important role in the separation of music skills from verbal skills and shaping the primordial music system the infant uses to address his/her musical needs. There is evidence that this system is timbre-based, rather than frequency-based, and “personal” – shaped by an ongoing communication between mother and infant."

Its earliest archaeological occurrences date back to the early Bronze Age, but its simplest constructions, made of tree twigs and bark, along with its cross-cultural connection to shamanic beliefs and doxological status, suggest its prehistoric use. I outline a possible scenario in which the spread of the cult of ancestral plants across this vast region, from Altai to Sakhalin, and the cult of the \"singing mask\" of the Tuva-Amur area may have given special importance to musicking on the JH, initiating its spread along pastoralism to the neighboring regions. The influence of the ancient \"talking JH\" tradition would explain vowel harmony found in most languages of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic families of the Transeurasian (aka \"Altaic\") family, as well as in neighboring Uralic languages - all of which are spoken by peoples that regularly use the JH."

    "description": "This report defines a new important field of inquiry for evolutionary musicology: the contribution of the physical properties of a specific material to the acoustic properties of a musical instrument made from that material. Since the timeline of human mastering of common manufacturing technologies is well established, it is possible to date the origin of certain types of indigenous instrumental music whose typical acoustic properties match the physical properties of certain materials. This is demonstrated in the example of the Jaw Harp (aka Jew’s Harp, JH). The spectral analysis of music common for 10 different materials identifies 14 types of JH “spectral texture” – i.e., a typological pattern of configuration of discrete spectral components akin to the scheme of integrating performing parts within a multi-part musical texture (e.g., duplum polyphony). Spectral textures of JHs made from grass structurally differ from those made from bamboo or wood/bone, and are radically different from those made of metals, especially steel. Therefore, those JH traditions that are indigenous for a given material can be dated in the following timeline: grass – bamboo – wood/bone – bronze – iron – brass – steel. This progression seems to chronologically correspond to the evolution of homophony which grew out of polyphony. This transition might have had a “natural” cause in the choice of the manufacturing material and should be attributed to the increasing dominance of metallic musical instruments over those made of organic materials."

Patterns of expression, specific for each aspect are shown to interact and form structural configurations that characterize different types of music, facilitating their interpretation by listeners. Unlike the existing methods of musicological analysis, limited to only 5 aspects and relying on rules forged by studying masterpieces of Western classical music, this new method is effective for understanding how communication occurs in virtually any form of traditional music, including those based on indefinite pitch, timbre, and pitchless rhythm. Moreover, as I demonstrate, this method is applicable to vocal communications that only resemble music (e.g., animal calls or infant babbling). The new format of visualization – “musogram” – allows an analyst to conveniently represent all 11 aspects of musical expression."

The initial line of development went cumulatively (newer schemes were added to the older ones) from timbre-based to pitch-based and thereafter towards a growing number of the pitch classes. Then, the development became superseding: each subsequent stage started supplanting the previous one. Three major divergences occurred, each generating a new pair of opposing alternatives: pentatonic versus heptatonic; chromatic versus diatonic; and Western tonality versus hemiolic (Eastern) tonality - where each alternative in the pair excludes the other."

Musical modes of the diatonic music systems were assigned to specific ethea by means of public conventions within the Ancient Greek and Babylonian cultures. The latter prototyped the semiotic system, designed to effectively convey emotional states that were viewed as “good” for society in order to supplant socially “bad” emotions. Within this perspective, the emergence of chromatic music in Hellenic Greece should be seen as the rise of a new theatrical aesthetic within a novel urban civilization - to replace the earlier ethical aesthetic of folk pastoral civilization. Chromatic alteration here acted as a tool of intensification of tonal tension with the purpose to impersonate humanistic character traits."

Such modes are extremely popular in Mediterranean, Balkan, and Central Asian countries, and originate from the Ancient Greek chromatic and enharmonic genera. Hemiolic modes form a special type of tonality – “Phrygian” – forming the “dominant keys” as opposed to the “tonic keys” of Western classical music tradition. Hence, the vast area from Spain to India should be regarded as a home to the hemiolic \"Mediterranean tonality\", in contrast to diatonic Western tonality. Their difference in structural implementation, as well as in their aesthetics, indicates the growing divergence between the Western and Eastern cultures of thought, which in turn are fueled by the cultural opposition of Western Christian and Islamic ideologies."

This technical paper proves otherwise: with the help of modern computer technology, it examines the tonal organization in 4 music excerpts and identifies a chromatic mode that must have evolved “naturally” – without the intervention of math-based formal music theory and notation, both of which are usually credited for the rise of chromatic Western music. Two examples, the South Russian koleda and the Montenegro gusle ballad, demonstrate a diatonic mode that only appears to be chromatic. However, the Pamir falak indisputably is based on a microtonal chromatic mode despite its performers adhering to the diatonic mugham theory (derivative of Arabic maqam). This case highlights the priority of etic analysis of music structure over the emic data collected by interviewing traditional performers."

The nucleus of the “B’utho” mode exactly matches the intervallic structure of the ancient tetrachords Synemmenón and Mesôn – violating the music theory of the Orthodox Christian chant, oktoechos. This again illustrates the priority of etic music analysis over blind trust to emic theoretic rules.

This scheme of tonal organization was regarded by Medieval Church authorities as a compromise between chromatic music descended from Ancient Greece, popular amongst common people yet “pagan,” and strict plainchant, ecclesiastically normative yet aesthetically unattractive to common listeners. In Russia, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Bulgaria, hypermode spread from liturgical music to secular folk songs."

    "description": "This paper presents a view into the prehistory of music, using the most recent data on biology, ethnomusicology, music sociology, archeology, and psychoacoustics. It concludes that pentatonic and heptatonic schemes of tonal organization appear to present two alternative prehistoric “mainstream” methods of ordering musical tones, each cultivating its own worldview and philosophy."

    "description": "This is a sequel to Evolution of Tonal Organization, Part-1. It completes the line of historic development of the principal methods of tonal organization from Bronze Age to Western and Near- and Far-Eastern civilizations of the 17th century AD.  It concludes that there seems to be a general historic vector of growing complexity and finer incrimination in each subsequent tonal scheme in the timeline of the rise and development of tonal organization."

    "description": "Organological evidence provides important data for reconstruction of tonal organization in prehistoric music that most researchers deem forever unknown. Viktor Beliayev, an expert in tuning of Eurasian folk instruments, stressed that musical instruments with finger-holes and frets preserve historical stages in the development of melody by fixing those pitch values that prevail in culturally important music. Such instruments are equivalent to musical notation – they perpetuate modes that are most popular within a community. It is possible to “read” this notation, following a set of principles proposed in this technical paper. It reviews the relative positioning of holes on all the recovered Paleolithic and Neolithic bone pipes. Distances between these holes represent the interval sets in pitch sets of music for which those bone pipes were designed."

    "description": "This summary briefly presents the classification system employed by the ethnomusicologists of the former Soviet Union and of the modern independent states formed after its disintegration. The value of this system is that it has been designed by the collective efforts of thousands of musicologists who possessed both etic and emic expertise in the analysis of music – and verified by the practice of arranging the genuine folk music according to the principles identified by music theorists and playing that arranged music back to indigenous audiences. The effectiveness of this system is demonstrated by the example of ekmelic (based on a set of steps that are indefinite in pitch) Yakut lullaby."
