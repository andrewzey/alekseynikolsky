    "pieceDescription": "My latest musical composition, “An American Dilemma: Trump and Circumstance”, is a tone poem that continues the lineage of representing America and its contribution to the world by means of symphonic art music as set by such composers as Antonin Dvorak, Charles Ives, Aaron Copland, and Leonard Bernstein. Its format is similar to Richard Strauss’ “A Hero’s Life”: using a  nexus of leitmotifs, the music unfolds the story of Trump in his rise to lead and represent a quite substantial part of the American population. Trump’s story reveals the extent to which the “blue-red” schism has split America, putting its cultural and political heritage and global leadership under question. The music aims at making the listener emotionally pass through all the episodes unveiling the storyline.",

    "pieceDescription" : "Here are 3 songs for soprano and chamber orchestra after Daniel Harms, a renowned Russian surrealist poet. This is my attempt to strike a right balance between modernity and tradition, while presenting a musical “movie” of the very bright surrealistic content of the songs. The music features clear themes, polymodal organization and bright emotional characteristics.\n\nThe first song is a pastoral about a wild girl, the mill-man’s daughter, who scares off the cattle out of the forest with her spooky eyes. \n\nThe second song describes how an entire town is deep asleep amidst the night except one man who stays up counting his money to his deep satisfaction. \n\nThe third song presents a story of a Scythian nomad who just assassinated a nobleman, and is pursued by the nobleman’s servants, gets wounded, and finally dies while the helpless gods are watching the entire event.",

    "pieceTitle" : "Ad Infinitum",
    "pieceYear" : 1989,

    "pieceDescription" : "In 1990, right before leaving Russia, I wrote a symphonic piece as a resolution to the conflicting feelings I had in mediating the past and the future of Russian culture. 1990 was a year of enormous changes in the USSR: the Communist Party all of a sudden dismissed itself, and yielded the ruling wheel to all sort of criminal elements of society, who within a few months merged with the government officials and “privatized” all precious resources in the country – at the absence of any laws to regulate such activities. This left good half of the country jobless, without any prospects.\n\nAt the time, I felt as though the entire civilization crushed – and Russian people will carry on eternal suffering that has been the trait of Russian history. This prompted me to employ a unique “Big Bang” musical form. The music starts and ends with a Big Bang, after which nothing is left - merely noise devoid of any tonal organization. And in between the beginning and end there are multitude of life forms, each of which grows from a germ, flourishes, then goes out of control and gets lost in chaos.\n\nThe entire macro form is built on a pool of minuscule motifs, some of which are tonally organized, and some others, atonally organized. Some motifs are attracted to one another forming melodies, some others repel, and some collide and explode into a chord. The entire harmonic system can be characterized as \"pan-tonality,\" housing poly-tonal components of musical texture in a “suspended” manner, resembling how planetary systems are separated by the interplanetary space. One might be able to spot local \"tonics\" in each of the components, but experience them as free floating in relation to each other.\n\n“Ad Infinitum” was inspired by the compositional principles of “analytical method” of Pavel Filonov in painting, and presents a monumental tombstone for Shostakovich’s “socialist realism” in symphonies – a manner of drawing the panorama of a contemporary society in a narrative of a musical composition.",
