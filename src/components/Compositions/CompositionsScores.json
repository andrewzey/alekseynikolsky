    "pieceDescription" : "Inspired by the impressionistic music of Ives and Debussy, I forged new style of tonal composition based on thematic writing in chromatic poly-modality. Each section of the music form relies on its own musical mode, the degrees of which receive chromatic alteration as needed in the process of the thematic development – to provide greater tension. I dedicated this work to Edison Denisov, who edited it during his last days in 1996 (despite his fatal illness) and strongly encouraged my compositional ideas. The orchestration pioneers a very unusual approach, emulating the pedalization on a grand piano by layering the decays in harmonic transitions. The resulting morphing effect contributes a special “sfumato” aura to otherwise quite straightforward harmonic functions.\n\nThe music unveils in a free-floating fashion akin Ravel’s Pavane, yet rhythmically articulated to illustrate the lackadaisical contemplation of a night in a big urban cityscape, as during a solitary walk by a bank of a river – perhaps, after a rain, when the air is fresh and streets are empty. The state of relaxation of mind while casual activity of walking provides a peculiar piece of urban poetics to replenish the listener’s soul.",

    "pieceDescription" : "This work is inspired by St. Bonaventure’s treatise “The Mind’s Road to God”, which summarizes the Neo-platonic philosophy of intellectual ascent, adopted by St. Augustine for Christian theology. According to this view, the world is a ladder for ascending to ultimate Truth in a way similar to learning about the artist by investigating his art. \n\nFollowing Bonaventure, I show 6 stages of elevation from the mere reflection on the corporeal elements, through realization of the mind’s own powers to discovery of Divine essence. Musically this is shown through progressive tonal integration: from isolated 12 tones to melodic and harmonic intervals, then to 3-tone motifs and chords, growing in number of tones, crystallization of melodic phrases and modes, leading to emergence of melodic line and thematic material. At this point the 6th stage builds the momentum, and the musical movement unleashes its run, bringing to life greater and greater harmonic functionality – until the qualitative transformation occurs, and modal tonality enables beautiful concordance of tones, symbolizing the mystical experience of the union with the Universe that brings peace to the spirit.",

    "pieceDescription": "Here are 3 songs for soprano and chamber orchestra after Daniel Harms, a renowned Russian surrealist poet. This is my attempt to strike a right balance between modernity and tradition, while presenting a musical “movie” of the very bright surrealistic content of the songs. The music features clear themes, polymodal organization and bright emotional characteristics.\n\nThe first song is a pastoral about a wild girl, the mill-man’s daughter, who scares off the cattle out of the forest with her spooky eyes. \n\nThe second song describes how an entire town is deep asleep amidst the night except one man who stays up counting his money to his deep satisfaction. \n\nThe third song presents a story of a Scythian nomad who just assassinated a nobleman, and is pursued by the nobleman’s servants, gets wounded, and finally dies while the helpless gods are watching the entire event.",

    "pieceYear": 1989,

    "pieceDescription": "In 1990, right before leaving Russia, I wrote a symphonic piece as a resolution to the conflicting feelings I had in mediating the past and the future of Russian culture. 1990 was a year of enormous changes in the USSR: the Communist Party all of a sudden dismissed itself, and yielded the ruling wheel to all sort of criminal elements of society, who within a few months merged with the government officials and “privatized” all precious resources in the country – at the absence of any laws to regulate such activities. This left good half of the country jobless, without any prospects.\n\nAt the time, I felt as though the entire civilization crushed – and Russian people will carry on eternal suffering that has been the trait of Russian history. This prompted me to employ a unique “Big Bang” musical form. The music starts and ends with a Big Bang, after which nothing is left - merely noise devoid of any tonal organization. And in between the beginning and end there are multitude of life forms, each of which grows from a germ, flourishes, then goes out of control and gets lost in chaos.\n\nThe entire macro form is built on a pool of minuscule motifs, some of which are tonally organized, and some others, atonally organized. Some motifs are attracted to one another forming melodies, some others repel, and some collide and explode into a chord. The entire harmonic system can be characterized as \"pan-tonality\", housing poly-tonal components of musical texture in a “suspended” manner, resembling how planetary systems are separated by the interplanetary space. One might be able to spot local \"tonics\" in each of the components, but experience them as free floating in relation to each other.\n\n\"Ad Infinitum\" was inspired by the compositional principles of “analytical method” of Pavel Filonov in painting, and presents a monumental tombstone for Shostakovich’s “socialist realism” in symphonies – a manner of drawing the panorama of a contemporary society in a narrative of a musical composition.",

    "pieceDescription": "This work represents my attempt to elaborate the techniques of handling musical material in traditional way – yet with originality. Five movements, contrasting in style, each reads like a chapter that takes place at a different location. \n\nEach movement pays contribution to a set of different historic musical styles: first movement – to Handel and Corelli, second – to Debussy and Bartok, third – Faure, Milhaud, Couperin and Ives, fourth – Alban Berg and Charlie Parker, and fifth – Schoenberg and Prokofiev (the latter applies to the score only: the audio recording features an earlier version without the Schoenberg-like section). Stylistically, I emulated merely the manner of tonal organization, and not characteristic harmonic or melodic patterns – therefore, avoiding poly-stylistic or eclectic flavor in the entire composition. \n\nOverall, this composition offers great variety of content, form, combined with bright and contrasting thematic material, charged with strong emotional characteristics – to demonstrate the solution to the crisis of content and contrast, which have been troubling the modernistic and post-modernistic composers ever since the 1940s.",
